### Overviews
#### [The Full Stack Design System](https://www.intercom.com/blog/the-full-stack-design-system/)
> In each case, the objects don’t just describe a UI widget. They mean something very specific in the context of the product.

#### [The myth that design systems solve easy problems](https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/the-myth-that-design-systems-solve-easy-problems/)
> Design systems fix the common problems, not the easy ones

#### [Introducing Spectrum: How Adobe Is Building a Design System at Scale](https://theblog.adobe.com/introducing-spectrum-adobe-building-design-system-scale/)


#### [How To Make Design Systems Work](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/how-to-make-design-systems-work-9db0c556ed82)
> design systems should be like the ship of Theseus — as their components change and are replaced, they should fundamentally remain the same vessel with the same purpose.

#### [The ABCs of Design Systems](https://medium.com/curiosity-by-design/the-abcs-of-design-systems-b1dc6198bb7c)
> Your design systems ability to bridge gaps between disciplines is a superpower

#### [Think like a chef: how to use a design system](https://ux.shopify.com/think-like-a-chef-how-to-use-a-design-system-ae1f0e0e0dd7)
> The components act as your ingredients, while the patterns and guides act as your recipes.

#### [Reimagining Design Systems at Spotify](https://spotify.design/articles/2019-12-16/reimagining-design-systems-at-spotify/)
> This time, we wanted to design our design system, just like we’d design one of our product experiences. We weren’t starting with a completely blank slate, though. We wanted to consolidate the resources we had, and create a system that felt unified, accessible, collaborative, and based on a coherent vision. Most importantly, we wanted a system that would fit with Spotify’s culture of autonomy—one that could scale across multiple platforms and use cases.

#### [State of Design Systems 2019](https://medium.com/google-design/state-of-design-systems-2019-ff5f26ada71)
> Design systems are not just an embodiment of aesthetics and brand identity, they represent an organization’s workflow and processes.

----

### Process
#### [Systems Thinking, Unlocked: Building an inclusive design language system](https://airbnb.design/systems-thinking-unlocked/)
> When creating a sustainable culture, your design system is only as strong as your relationships with the teams who use it.

#### [Practicing Design Systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/practicing-design-systems-4029decf9e30)
This article is great for the early stages of design system development. It includes a great activity to get everyone on the same page with the priority of high-level user stories such as "As an adopter, how do I get updates".

#### [Starting a Design System](http://danmall.me/articles/starting-a-design-system/)
> A good design system should be a collection of your organization’s best institutional knowledge.

#### [An illustrated pseudo-scientific approach to design system principles](https://uxdesign.cc/an-illustrated-pseudo-scientific-approach-to-design-system-principles-10031a410cd0)
> Having product principles to help guide individual and team decision making meaningfully improves our collective product process.

#### [What makes a good design principle](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/principles.html)
> Good design principles are memorable.
> Good design principles help you say no.
> Good design principles aren’t truisms.
> Good design principles are applicable.

#### [Art of Diplomacy](https://medium.com/tap-to-dismiss/art-of-diplomacy-2ad1e2cac795)
> At the end of the day, the system is an internal tool and our coworkers are its users. Their human, just like us, and they want to do a good job, just like us. By empathizing, reassuring, educating, remaining flexible, sharing, communicating, and staying positive we’ve overcome many hurdles and are excited to take on new challenges in the future.

#### [Design Quality Components](https://medium.com/tap-to-dismiss/design-quality-components-a86ec8691fd2)
> A quality component feels like the company and works as intended every time for all users — a crafted balance of brand essence and science.

#### [Pairing is the key to evangelizing your design system](https://www.figma.com/blog/pairing-is-the-key-to-evangelizing-your-design-system/)
> But it turns out a design system can't be perfected in solitude because it's rooted in human relationships. It serves as a mirror for the company, a reflection of the dynamics at play between designers, engineers, product managers and even customers. 

#### [Size in Design Systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/size-in-design-systems-64f234aec519)
> 


#### [Stability in Design Systems](https://medium.com/designbetter/is-your-design-system-stable-52dddddeb4fa)
> Reduce the distance between your documentation and code. By co-locating documentation and code, it’s more likely that you’ll remember to update the documentation when a component changes.

#### [Tracking Polaris](https://ux.shopify.com/tracking-polaris-adfa97f42c3f)
> Barriers to involvement are often invisible
> The more complex an organization gets, the more we need to lean on a system to enable competent, cohesive decisions

#### [Sustainable Design Systems | decoupling purpose from outputs](https://tinyletter.com/alanbsmith/letters/sustainable-design-systems-decoupling-purpose-from-outputs)
> If you try to over-optimize for UI consistency, you’ll end up with a system that is too rigid or can’t adapt to consumer needs. If you over-emphasize development speed, you’ll likely sacrifice quality.
> *Instead, we should optimize for resilience and adaptability.*
> [Alan B Smith](https://twitter.com/_alanbsmith)

#### [A Design System Governance Process](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-design-system-governance-process/)
> Product teams’ primary concern is getting work out the door, not to uphold the integrity of the design system.

### Documentation

#### [How we built a component library that people actually enjoy using](https://medium.com/styled-components/how-to-build-a-great-component-library-a40d974a412d)
> Great documentation should be less like a document and more like a workshop.

#### [Myths of Documenting Components](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/myths-of-documenting-components-29a589500505)
> The most important thing I’ve learned about writing doc is to always be writing doc. Don’t trigger it by a step in the process. Instead, start a living document that grows as you research, design, code and complete a system feature.
> - Adam Rowe, Morningstar Design System

#### [Authoring Component Documentation](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/authoring-component-documentation-6f894b498b88)
> There’s always more stories to tell, more scenarios to exhibit, more guidelines you could write. Some of them are important. But maybe not as much as other things you could do. And that’s ok. Don’t get anxious about it. Your end goal isn’t doc, it’s end-customer experience quality and speed-to-market.

#### [7 tips for starting writing and maintaining your documentation](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-i-document-7-tips-for-starting-writing-and-maintaining-your-documentation-6e858af64c0)
> Update when someone asks you a question — this is probably my biggest piece of advice on the topic of documentation.

#### [Handling example copy in design systems](https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/example-copy-in-design-systems/)
> In the GOV.UK Design System, which I work on, we use realistic copy in most of our examples. We’ve found it helps to give our users an idea of how something works in context and shows, at least implicitly, what good copy looks like.

#### [Readme driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)

#### [Getting design system customization just right](https://ux.shopify.com/getting-design-system-customization-just-right-3012151ef5ea)
> Guided theme building allows your components to be themed to a degree that allows third parties to use them to create their own product, with its own look and feel, but removes the risk of people over-customizing them. 

#### [How Fluent UI Unlocks the Next Generation of Microsoft 365 Experiences](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/how-fluent-ui-unlocks-the-next-generation-of-microsoft-365-experiences-8b24809faf06)

----

### Animation
#### [Including Animation In Your Design System](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/animation-design-system/)
> The most effective design systems contain a branded point of view unique to them — things that make their design system more specific to the product they’re for — along with common design best practices.

#### [Integrating Animation Into a Design System](https://alistapart.com/article/integrating-animation-into-a-design-system)

#### [Measuring the impact of a design system](https://medium.com/@didoo/measuring-the-impact-of-a-design-system-7f925af090f7)
> The reason for introducing a design system in a company is not because so people can work less, but because so people can work better. I want people to focus on the important things, and reduce the amount of repetitive work they do.


----

### Research
#### [Maintaining design systems with user research](https://medium.com/elisa-design/maintaining-design-systems-with-user-research-3ba5feafc336)
> Even though there is plenty of design systems by other companies, they all address certain business needs which most likely differ from ours.

----

### Naming
#### [How to name UI components](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-name-ui-components-fd06b84e92dc)
> Good names help team members who did not design or build the patterns understand their use.
> Good names help onboard new hires faster.
> Good names are memorable.

### Versioning / Releasing

#### [Versioning Design Systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/versioning-design-systems-48cceb5ace4d)

### Content

#### [Why your design system should include content](https://medium.com/@rachel.mcconnell/why-your-design-system-should-include-content-c1fb7109ba88)

#### [When copy components work — and when they fail](https://medium.com/@z.jurgen/when-copy-components-work-and-when-they-fail-f40c3a6ae4c5)
> Use all your powers to give your offsite / unsupported teams every conceivable resource and tool they’ll need to help themselves. You can never guarantee that their copy will be wonderful, but at least you’re helping establish some kind of baseline. Unremarkable functional copy is always better than utterly fucked copy.

#### [Content in, for, and of Design Systems](https://medium.com/indeed-design/content-in-for-and-of-design-systems-80f565d77902)


----

### Technology

#### [managing technology-agnostic design systems](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/managing-technology-agnostic-design-systems/)
